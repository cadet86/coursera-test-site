	<h1>Floating Elements</h1>
	<div>
		<p id="p1">A floated element is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available of the containing element. Other elements normally flow around the floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their clear property.</p>
		<p id="p2">To clear a float, add the clear property to the element that needs to clear the float. This is usually the element after the floated element. The clear property can take the values of left , right , and both . Usually you'll want to use both.</p>
		
		<Section>This is regular contect continuing after the paragraph boxes. </Section>
