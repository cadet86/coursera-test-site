	<p>In 1957, the Space Age began with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. Since then, the number of objects humans have hurled toward the stars has soared to the thousands. As those objects have collided with one another, they've created more space debris in Earth's orbit. According to some estimates, all of that debris and human-made space trash, the number of objects — from satellites to screws — could be in the millions.</p>

This debris has to be tracked to avoid collisions, which can force the International Space Station (ISS) to be redirected, disrupting pre-planned initiatives like space walks. A collision with space debris as small as 1 cm could penetrate ISS shields, harming the station. And the more objects we launch into orbit, the denser the traffic becomes to navigate.

One potential solution? Apply ideas of green sustainability to the companies and governments that do the launching, says Danielle Wood, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.

As part of Short Wave's AAAS live show series, Danielle sat down with co-host Aaron Scott to talk about a vision of sustainability in space. The effort begins with the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR), an incentive system modeled after LEED certifications for green buildings. The system is multifaceted, considering aspects like collision preparedness, information sharing and future debris reductions. At least one company has already applied for and received a certification using the SSR. That initial rating was bronze, the lowest of four possible ratings.
